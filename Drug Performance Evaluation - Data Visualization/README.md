## Drug Performance Evaluation Project

### Overview

The goal of this project is to evaluate drug performance using statistical analysis and data visualization. The client requires detailed analysis and insights to address their problem effectively.

### Assignment Instructions

1. **Create a SMART Problem Statement**
   - Define a clear and specific problem statement that is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART).

2. **Problem Elaboration using 5W+1H**
   - What is the minimum number of reviews required to consider data as significant?
   - Which disease occurs most frequently?
   - What are the 5 most effective drugs for the most frequent disease?
   - What are the prices of the top 5 effective drugs? How much is the drug with the lowest price?
   - How is the distribution of different drug forms (e.g., tablets, capsules, liquids) based on its ease of use rating?
   - How does the ease of use rating correlate with its satisfaction levels? Is there a trend where higher ease of use leads to higher satisfaction levels?
   - Which drugs gain higher satisfaction levels: prescription (RX) or over-the-counter (OTC)?
   - How do the top 5 drugs perform in terms of effectiveness, ease of use, and satisfaction levels?

3. **Identify and Extract Necessary Data**
   - Determine the metrics/data required.
   - Extract the necessary data from the specified dataset using SQL.

4. **Ensure Problem Elaboration for Data Visualization and Statistical Analysis Meets the Following Criteria:**
   - Create `6 elaborations` where 4 are for `data visualization`, 1 for `descriptive statistics`, and 1 for `inferential statistics`.

8. **Project Output**
   - A data visualization dashboard using `Tableau Public`.
   - Conduct analysis and data processing in a `jupyter notebook`.

This README outlines the project goals, instructions, and tasks to provide a comprehensive evaluation of drug performance. The aim is to extract, prepare, analyze, and visualize data to generate actionable insights for the client.
