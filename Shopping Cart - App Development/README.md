# Shopping Cart Project

## Objectives

This project is designed to evaluate the concepts of Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Object-Oriented Programming, Python Unit Test, and Computational Thinking as follows:

- Apply conditional `if` statements in a case
- Implement `while` loops
- Create objects using classes
- Create methods within objects using functions
- Test the code using `unittest`
- Illustrate a flowchart

## Assignment Instructions and Cases

**Case**

As a Python developer at a retail company, the task is to create a simple `shopping cart` program that allows users to add, remove, and view items in their shopping cart. Each item will have information such as the item name and its price. Users should also be able to see the total price of their cart.

**Requirements**

1. A flowchart illustrating the program flow
2. Create a class named `ShoppingCart` to represent each user's shopping cart. This class should include methods to add items, remove items, calculate the total price, and run the user interface of the application. It should also contain an attribute `items`, which is a list of item objects in the shopping cart.
3. Develop unit tests for the `ShoppingCart` class using `unittest`.

This README provides an overview of the project's objectives and requirements. The main goal is to create a functional shopping cart program with a corresponding flowchart and thorough unit testing.
